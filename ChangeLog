	When a high score is obtained, it is highlighted in red when the high scores
	window is automatically displayed. Looks like the threading bugs may have been
	resolved (yay!). Bumped the version up to beta, since it's been stable for a
	while (relative to a few weeks ago; though this is more due to school starting
	than me running out of features to implement).
	Released version 1.0.3b.

2005-01-09 Michael Kelly <michael AT michaelkelly.org>
	Clicking "cancel" at the high score prompt screen now doesn't add your
	score to the list (instead of adding "Anonymous"), and doesn't display
	the high score list.
	Released version 1.0.2a6.

2005-01-05 Michael Kelly <michael AT michaelkelly.org>
	There were three outstanding bugs ("gravity" turns off, but pieces can
	still be moved; complete freeze; and spurious endgame and/or "ghost"
	pieces). I completely re-did the synchronization scheme. It should
	work now. How many of the bugs this fixes remains to be seen (all, I
	hope).
	Released version 1.0.2a5.

2005-01-02 Michael Kelly <michael AT michaelkelly.org>
	Fixed timekeeping bug reported by Alex.
	Released version 1.0.2a4.

2005-01-02 Michael Kelly <michael AT michaelkelly DOT org>
	More debugging. I suspect there's a threading bug. Unfortunately, only
	Alex can reproduce it.
	Released version 1.0.2a3.

2005-01-01 Michael Kelly <michael@michaelkelly DOT org>

	should. More scoring changes! Added 5 point bonus per piece landed.
	Dropping pieces only gives you 1 point per square instead of 10.
	Average score plunges. Softened speed progression at higher levels.
	Released version 1.0.2a1.

2005-01-01 Michael Kelly <michael AT michaelkelly DOT org>
	Added 5 point bonus for every piece frozen. More HighScoreWindow
	tweaks. Fixed bug involving selecting "new game" during a running game
	by simply disallowing it. Happy new year.
	Released version 1.0.2a.

2004-12-31 Michael Kelly <michael AT michaelkelly DOT org>
