1. COMPILING
============

If you have the source code, follow these directions. If you have the .jar,
skip directly to 'RUNNING THE PROGRAM'.

(Short version)
$ make
$ java -jar TetrisJ.jar

(Long version)
There's a rudimentary Makefile. Just cd into the source directory (which should
be the directory this file's in) and type 'make'. If you make changes and want
to recompile the whole thing, hit 'make clean' (this deletes all the .class
files) before running 'make' again (or just do 'make new' to automatically run
'make clean' and 'make'). The makefile is very stupid... it's mostly just a
shortcut for running javac and jar, it doesn't handle dependencies well/at all.

After 'make', you will have a bunch of .class files (which you can kill, if you
want; 'make classclean'), and TetrisJ.jar.

2. RUNNING THE PROGRAM
======================

To run it, type the following on the command line ('$' is the prompt):
$ java -jar TetrisJ.jar

In OS X and WinXP you should be able to double-click it. (The program doesn't
work at all in OS 9, because there's no Swing implementation.)

There may be other OS-specific ways for you to run it from a command-line or
GUI.

If you downloaded the source, you can type 'make run' to run the program, as
well.

3. ABOUT
========

This is yet another implementation of Tetris. If you don't know how to play
Tetris yet, here's the premise and the goals:

Pieces fall from the top of the screen to the bottom. You can move them left
and right, rotate them, and drop them immediately to the bottom. Your goal is
to drop pieces so they completely fill a row (color doesn't matter). When this
happens, the row disappears, and all rows above it shift down.

You get more points for clearing more rows at a time, and a few points for
every square you drop a piece (as opposed to waiting for it to fall of its own
accord).

There is a preview window which shows you the piece that will drop next. You
can turn it off for a 15% score bonus.

This implementation is released under the GNU GPL. See the 'COPYING' file for
the full text of the license.

4. WHY?
=======

Why did I write yet another Tetris clone? Because I couldn't find any existing
ones I liked on Linux. Some were pretty, but lacked a good high-scores feature,
some weren't so pretty, some had massive feature bloat, and one came with an
attached text editor. ;) So, I wrote this.

I was also inspired by the Shaw Household Tetris Rules:
<http://www.dougshaw.com/tetris/>, because I hadn't come across any games that
implemented the Ultra and Sprint modes. (They still aren't implemented in this
game, but they will be, someday. I promise. Really.)

5. THANKS
=========

My dad, for introducing me to the game and testing this version.

Alex Dodge, for finding bugs and suggesting features.

Tetris Max, <http://members.chello.at/theodor.lauppert/games/tetris_max.htm>,
For being a great implementation of Tetris, and my first real introduction to
the game. Moo.

Gnometris, for having a nice clean interface for me to shamelessly copy.

JTris, <http://jtris.sourceforge.net>, for making me realize I had to change
the name. (And for being a reference for getting KeyEvents working.)

People who write open source code everywhere, for writing so many of the tools
I use every day.
