Features yet to be implemented:

* Start at user-defined level!
* Pre-existing rubble (variable lines, variable density)
* Images for tiles
* Background images?
* Game logs facilitating replays.
	- mark whether game aborted or lost
* Internalize key repeat delay and repeat rate
* Rewrite GravityThread and TimerThread using TimerTask?
	<http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/threads/timer.html>
* Ultra and Sprint game modes
* Global totals: total time played, time spent, lines cleared, etc.
	- make note of when log started

* Consider: clearing all but top 5 scores, or "recent scores" list, or both

Far off in the future...

* Battle mode (2 people at the same keyboard)

Even farther...

* Networked multiplayer
